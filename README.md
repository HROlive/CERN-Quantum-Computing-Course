# Quantum-Computing-Course-CERN

Recent developments in quantum technology are bringing the world closer to a new technological revolution – the advent of usable quantum computers able to provide enormous acceleration to important computational tasks​. In coming years, quantum computing is expected to have a huge impact on practically all areas of research that can utilise computational modelling.

Starting operations in April this year, the NordΙQuEst project brings together a consortium of seven partners from five Nordic and Baltic countries to connect world-leading traditional HPC resources and quantum computers across national borders with the aim to establish a quantum computing platform customised to the needs of the region.

ENCCS is now joining forces with NordIQuEst to deliver a two-day training workshop covering the fundamentals of quantum computing (QC), including:

Introduction to key concepts: quantum states, qubits, quantum algorithms
QC programming in high-level languages for use cases in optimisation, finance and quantum chemistry followed by testing quantum programs to esure their correctness
Overview of the main QC hardware approaches
Integration of QC with classical computing: hybrid classical/quantum algorithms and HPC-QC systems.
Morning lectures are combined with afternoon hands-on sessions where participants learn to use high-level QC programming languages using simulators.
